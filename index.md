# About this list

In 2015, we performed a survey and initiated a Call for Data submission Globally . This helped us to analyze and re-categorize the OWASP Mobile Top Ten for 2016. So the top ten categories are now more focused on Mobile application rather than Server.

Our goals for the 2016 list included the following:

- Updates to the wiki content; including cross-linking to testing guides, more visual exercises, etc;
- Generation of more data; and
- A PDF release.

This list has been finalized after a 90-day feedback period from the community. Based on feedback, we have released a Mobile Top Ten 2016 list following a similar approach of collecting data, grouping the data in logical and consistent ways.
